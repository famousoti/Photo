    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/pi8.jpg" alt="Photographer Photo">
    <p>I am a professional photographer with over 10 years of experience capturing life's beautiful moments. My services include wedding photography, portraits, and events.
        Hi, I’m Famosoti., a passionate photographer dedicated to capturing moments that tell a story. With a unique eye for detail and a deep love for visual art, I strive to bring out the extraordinary in everyday scenes. Whether it's portraits, landscapes, or street photography, my work focuses on the interplay of light, shadow, and emotion to create timeless images. For me, photography is more than just a profession—it's a way to connect with people, places, and experiences in a meaningful way. Through my lens, I aim to capture not only what you see but also what you feel. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to working with you to create unforgettable memories.
